From the index view, you have the option to view a list of computers or create a new computer.  When viewing the list, you will also see the currently assigned employee.

If you click on the 'create new' link, it will bring you to a form where you can add in the details of a computer (make, manufacturer, and purchase date) and assign it to an employee.  Please note: An employee can only have one computer at a time.  Assigning an employee to a new computer will unassign them from any previous computers.

From the index view you can also click on the make or manufacturer of the computer to go to a details view.  Here you will see additional details about the computer such as the purchase date and decommission date (if applicable).  From this view, you can delete the computer.  NOTE you can only delete a computer if it has never been assigned to an employee.
